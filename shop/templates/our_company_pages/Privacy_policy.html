                                                      <p>Trusted Shops widgets (e.g. Trusted Shops Trustbadge) are integrated in this website to display Trusted Shops services (e.g. Trustmark, collected reviews) and to offer Trusted Shops products to buyers after they have placed an order.</p>
                                                      <p>This serves to protect our legitimate interests in optimized marketing by enabling secure shopping in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which prevail in the context of a balancing of interests. The trust badge and the services advertised with it are an offer of Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Cologne (Trusted Shops). We and Trusted Shops are joint controllers in data protection terms pursuant to Art. 26 GDPR. In the following section, we inform you about the essential contents of the joint controllership agreement according to Art. 26 (2) GDPR.</p>
                                                      <p>The trust badge is provided as part of a joint controllership by a US CDN provider (content delivery network). An adequate level of data protection is ensured by standard data protection clauses and other contractual measures. Further information on the privacy policy of Trusted Shops GmbH can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trustedshops.co.uk/imprint/#user-privacy-policy" class="link-inside-privacy-policy">here</a>.</p>
                                                      <p>When the Trustbadge is viewed, the web server automatically saves a so-called server log file, which also contains your IP address, the date and time of access, the amount of data transferred and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the access. The IP address is anonymized immediately after collection, so that the stored data cannot be assigned to your person. The server log file is stored in a security database for the analysis of security anomalies and automatically deleted or anonymized not later than 90 days after creation. According to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, this serves the our and Trusted Shops' legitimate interests to prevent cases of misuse and fraud, to optimize our offers and websites, and to ensure trouble-free operation of the website, the Trustbadge and other Trusted Shops widgets.</p>
                                                      <p>Further personal data is transferred to Trusted Shops GmbH if you decide to use Trusted Shops products after completing an order or if you have already registered to use them. For this purpose, personal data is automatically collected from the order data. To check automatically whether you as a buyer are already registered for product use, a neutral parameter, e.g. the e-mail address hashed by cryptological one-way function, is used. The e-mail address is converted into this hash value, which cannot be decrypted by Trusted Shops, before it is transmitted. After checking for a match, the parameter is automatically deleted.</p>
                                                      <p>This serves to check whether you are already registered for services with Trusted Shops GmbH and is therefore necessary to safeguard our and Trusted Shops' prevailing legitimate interests in the fulfillment of the buyer protection linked to the specific order and the transactional review services pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If this is the case, further processing will be carried out in accordance with the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops. If you have not yet registered for the services, you will be given the opportunity to do so for the first time. Further processing after registration also depends on the contractual agreement with Trusted Shops. If you do not register, all transmitted data is automatically deleted by Trusted Shops and a personal reference is then no longer possible.</p>
                                                      <p>Within the framework of the joint controllership between us and Trusted Shops GmbH, please contact Trusted Shops GmbH if you have any data protection questions or wish to assert your rights.
